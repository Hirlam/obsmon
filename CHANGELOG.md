Obsmon is a tool for observation monitoring in the Harmonie-Arome NWP System. It is composed of two parts: The backend and the frontend. The backend is part of the scripting system and produces databases with the relevant information as part of the post-processing. The frontend allows the analysis and visualization of this data. This software, and all files contained here, correspond only to the frontend part of the full Obsmon package. In this document, however, "obsmon" will always refer to the frontend part, unless otherwise specified.
